We have implemented three string searching algorithms, (1) a naive method approach,
(2) the Rabin-Karp algorithm, and (3) KnuthMorris-Pratt (KMP) algorithm.
The naive method simply compares every character in the file with the characters in the string (pattern) we
are looking for. To run any of the three algorithms, you will have to go to that class and run their main method,
they each have a main method. They do take tow arguments, the first is the file path of the file we will be looking in,
and the second argument is the pattern we are looking for.  We included a Java class called TestFileBuilder that
creates a test text file customized by you.
